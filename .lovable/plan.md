# 💘 Valentine's Proposal Page

A single dramatic, funny, and playful "Be my Valentine?" page that uses humor and your two GIFs to deliver the big question.

## The Experience

### 1. The Opening — Dramatic Entrance
- The page opens with a dark, moody background and the **chest pain GIF** front and center
- Big dramatic text fades in: **"Ever since I met you..."**
- Below it: **"I've had this weird pain in my chest..."**
- The vibe is intentionally dramatic and over-the-top, like a medical emergency 😄

### 2. The Reveal — Plot Twist
- After a beat (or on scroll/click), the mood shifts — the background brightens with hearts and warm colors
- The chest pain GIF transitions out and is replaced by text: **"Turns out... it's just my heart beating for you 💓"**
- Playful floating hearts animation fills the background

### 3. The Big Question — Minion Moment
- The **Minion GIF** appears, looking up in awe
- Big, bold, animated text: **"Will you be my Valentine? 🥺"**
- The Minion's awestruck expression perfectly sells the hopeful, puppy-dog-eyes moment

### 4. The Interactive Finale — Yes/No Buttons
- Two buttons appear: **"Yes! 💕"** and **"No 😢"**
- **The "No" button runs away** from the cursor every time the user tries to click it — it dodges, shrinks, teleports around the page
- When they inevitably click **"Yes"** → 🎉 **CONFETTI EXPLOSION!**
- A celebration screen appears with hearts, sparkles, and a sweet closing message like **"I knew you'd say yes! (You can't resist me) 🥰"**
- Both GIFs can reappear in the celebration for a fun callback

## Design & Vibe
- **Color scheme**: Dark/moody at the start → warm pinks, reds, and golds for the reveal
- **Typography**: Bold, expressive fonts — dramatic at first, then playful
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-ins, floating hearts, the bouncy runaway No button, and a big confetti burst
- **Mobile-friendly**: Works great on phones since they'll likely send a link to their Valentine
